# 👋 Hi, I'm Adesh

**Solidity Developer** specializing in **Smart Contract Security** and **Gas Optimization**

## 🔭 Currently Working On

- **DeFi Security Research:** Simulating historical exploits (Euler, Balancer, SushiSwap, Nomad) to understand attack vectors and build prevention strategies
- **Account Abstraction:** Gas-optimized ERC-4337 multi-signature wallets with ERC-20 gas payment options and comprehensive testing
- **Cross-Chain Protocols:** CCIP-based rebase tokens and bridge mechanisms
- **High-Performance Tools:** Real-time blockchain bots in Rust for MEV and token detection

## 💼 Experience

**Blockchain Developer** | Unbound Finance & DefiedEdge | 2.5+ years
- Deployed and maintained DeFi protocols across 8+ EVM chains (Ethereum, Polygon, BSC, Avalanche, Arbitrum, Optimism, Base)
- Executed 40+ mainnet deployments across multiple networks and protocol versions
- Managed protocol operations, including fee collection, debugging production issues, and multi-chain coordination
- Implemented deployment strategies for protocol upgrades and cross-chain functionality

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
